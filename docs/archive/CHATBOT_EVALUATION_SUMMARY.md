## Test Results Analysis

### Scenario: "Can you write a will for me?"

## Scoring Framework Created

### Categories & Weights:
1. **Legal Accuracy (30%)** - Correctness of legal information
2. **POPIA Compliance (10%)** - Data protection adherence
3. **Conversational Quality (25%)** - Relevance, clarity, tone
4. **Technical Performance (20%)** - Response time, error handling
5. **User Experience (25%)** - Consistency, context retention

### Key Metrics:
- Minimum acceptable score: 70/100
- Target score: >85/100
- Critical failure triggers (automatic fail):

  - Offering to create legal documents

## Current Status

### Strengths:

- Consultation recommendations

### Remaining Opportunities:

- Enhanced urgency detection for emergency situations

## Recommendations for Continuous Improvement

### Immediate Actions:
1. Monitor user interactions weekly
2. Track failed responses and patterns
3. Adjust prompts based on common issues
4. Regular testing with evaluation framework

### Long-term Enhancements:

2. Add user feedback collection
3. Create specialized prompts for practice areas
4. Build knowledge base of common SA legal scenarios

## Compliance & Risk Management

### Next Steps:
1. Deploy evaluation system for regular monitoring
2. Collect real user feedback
3. Fine-tune based on actual usage patterns
4. Expand test scenarios based on user queries
